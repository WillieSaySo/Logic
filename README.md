**The Incompleteness Theorem Refuted**

**The Problem:** Kurt Gödel’s famous Incompleteness theorem, quickly summarized in simple terms, is that while logic is able to account for its own machinations, making it a complete system, there can be no foundational axioms for arithmetic without an appeal to intuition. Due to this, mathematics will always be considered an incomplete system. The logicians’ dream of proving with completeness that 1 + 1 = 2 will forever be unattainable because of this fact.


**The Solution:** This used to be true and immutable, but numbers as we know them are changing. While we used to understand numbers that are only positive or negative within the realm of arithmetic (not including zero), our general sense of numbers has expanded with the growth of consciousness. Just as we’re now able to conceptualize and sense new colors with consciousness evolution, we’re now able to do the same with numbers. As we approach the arrival of the paradoxical set that contains all sets, we now have a third category — super numbers, numbers superpositioned between positive and negative. We know it’s evident these numbers must exist because they’re already accounted for in absolute values, which we’ll use to express super numbers for the time being.


It also helps to take into consideration that Arabic numbers were first conceptualized without negative values. As such, it becomes evident that what we first considered to be a positive 2 was in fact a neutral 2, conceptualized in relation to 1 rather than -2. This introduces even a second kind of new number (neutral numbers) with their own value systems in the field of simple arithmetic.


Neutral: 1

Negative: -1

Super: |1|

Positive: +1


**The theorem:**

Neutral numbers quantify the following subsets:

0 = {0} v ~{<0<}

1 = -1 v |1| v +1

2 = (-1&-1) v (|1|&|1|) v (+1&+1)

3 = [(-1&-1&-1) v (|1|&|1|&|1|) v (+1&+1&+1)] v [(-2&-1) v (|2|&|1|) v (+2&+1)]


This gets very complicated to express very quickly, as even up to neutral 4 will require taking into consideration (|2|&|2|) as well as (|2|&|1|&|1|) and (|3|&|1|), et al, but the overarching principles will remain the same. Beyond solving the age-old dilemma of how 1 + 1 = 2, it demonstrates this is how we conceived of the number 2 in the first place! This isn’t only applicable in a function, it demonstrates how numbers were first formulated. It changes number theory as we know it, proving once and for all that beyond their existence as relational claims, numbers are words with linguistic laws of semantics and syntax attached. It also may provide an alternative view to the imaginary number i as the square root of -1, since |1| x |1| fulfills all necessary values.


With this arrival of new number theory, we discover two surprising principles:


1. Numbers, like words, are objects with existence beyond self-reference and interrelational claims, adhering the laws of mathematics to the laws of linguistics, and vice-versa.

2. The greatest difference between the values of different base systems is in the expression of the numbers, collapsing possibility/modality into concretia/actualization in simplified terms.
    

Those who find beauty in the sublime language of mathematics and logic may understand the gravity of these two findings. Together, for the first time, this allocates capacity for poesis (read: poetics) in numerical expression. It also illustrates how super numbers provide bandwidth for the problem of possibility/modality in empirical reality, in that supernumbers may determine neutral 3 could equal -3, -1, +1, or +3. This bridges the gaps of quantum computations and allows us to tie it into the empirical realm of multiverse theory. It’s no longer a dichotomy of Universe v multiverse, the actual world may well all be considered together as the Superverse.


**Conclusion:** Numbers, like words, are intentional vibrations which determine the necessary and the possible, and act to collapse the wavelengths of possibility into the actual. As such, by discovering the foundational axioms of arithmetic, we’re also provided with the necessary language to describe all of the Universe in mathematical expression — not with cold and unemotional numbers, as some fear, but in exquisite aesthetics which account for every anomaly and deviation as part of its neverending math equation. A claim for intuition is no longer necessary to prove 1 + 1 = 2, but rather the preference to express it as 2 rather than +1&+1.
